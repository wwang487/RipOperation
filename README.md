# RipOperation
This is the code for tracking rip currents and characterizing their features from web-cam images.

## Background-LOCKS
The Lifeguarding Operational Camera Kiosk System (LOCKS) is a real-time monitoring system for rip current detection and warning, deployed at Port Washington, Wisconsin, on the western shore of Lake Michigan. LOCKS captures water surface images every 10 seconds and transmits them to a backend PC station for processing. If hazardous flash rip currents are detected, the system automatically issues alerts through an on-site warning system.
